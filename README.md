1. Write a Flask application implementing a REST API to serve the content of the [colors.json](resources/colors.json) file.
   Feel free to add any framework/library which you think is necessary for this purpose. The user should be able to
   perform the following operations:
    * Retrieve the whole list of colors
    * Retrieve a single color from the list
    * Insert a new color into the list
1. Write automated tests for the API. You can use any tool/framework which you think is necessary to do that.
1. Prepare your application to be deployed and executed in a containerized environment, using `podman`. Provide the
   needed files for the deployment.
1. Provide documentation for deployment and utilization of the API. You may use any kind of format for the
   documentation.
